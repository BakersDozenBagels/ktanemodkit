Community fork of the KTaNE Modkit.

The [original (official) modkit](https://github.com/keeptalkinggame/ktanemodkit) isn't going to receive updates anymore. This is the fork that will be maintained from now on.

On this branch, community-made modding features are added to the modkit.

A modkit with only the base features can be found on the [base_fatures branch](https://github.com/qkrisi/ktanemodkit/tree/base_features).

A temporary wiki can be found [here](https://github.com/keeptalkinggame/ktanemodkit/wiki).

To get more help, join the [KTaNE Discord server](https://discord.gg/ktane).

-Multiple Bombs Mission Editor (By Lupo511)
-KeepCoding (By Emik)
```
